Well, it should not to be mentioned under this blogspace. Nevertheless, for the fun sake of it, I started to learn computer programming (now that it's been nearly 8 years since I wrote my first proper computer program using C ). A friend of mine introduced me to a book he was having as a gift to his dad (who is starting to program). This book is titled 'Learn to Program' and it should be sufficient to say that it belongs to the 'Pragmatic Series' from the Pragmatic Programmers.

The book is amazingly interactive. I laughed and smiled while learning to program using this book. The author has done a commendable job in writing this book in such an lucid manner.

And what can I tell about Ruby? From One-Click Download and Installation upto using the SciTE editor, everything was simple and neat. Not a single problem. The language is also very very light in appearance and does a good job. I am loving it every day. Looks like after a long time, the need for learning a language for fun has really brought some fruit. Ruby is fun. No doubt! I don't have current plans to use it for my projects. But, I may consider it to create website using the Ruby On Rails MVC Web Framework.
