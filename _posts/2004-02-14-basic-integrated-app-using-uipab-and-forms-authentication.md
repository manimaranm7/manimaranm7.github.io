Just yesterday afternoon, when I thought of having a difficult weekend to crack the problem with UIPAB, lightning struck. I got a reply to my question posted to news.microsoft.public.dotnet.distributed_apps redirecting me to GotDotNET workspace where a fix to the Back button problem with UIPAB was posted. God, that was timing. Had the reply come at sometime evening, I would have been spending my entire day today searching for alternatives for UIPAB (specifically <a href="http://mavnet.sourceforge.net/">Maverick</a>) and working on it. ( I think i'll take some time off and try Maverick some time before UIPAB v 2.0 release).
<br />
<br />As such, the Fix for Back button problem ( <a href="http://groups.msn.com/BDotNet/general.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=12337&amp;LastModified=4675459353602606026">http://groups.msn.com/BDotNet/general.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=12337&amp;LastModified=4675459353602606026</a> for a description on the problem) did infact work out very well. I guess, the fix has been taken care in UIPAB v2.0.
<br />
<br />With this fix, I managed to complete a Demo application integrating UIPAB and Forms Authentication yesterday evening.
<br />
<br />The demo application will be used in my presentation on Monday to share my knowledge on UIPAB and Forms Authentication to my collegues.
<br />
<br />Currently trying to use Data Access Applicaton Block in my demo application.
