This week began very boring, without any focus and always busy thinking of doing new things rather than solving the problems at hand.
<br />
<br />This has happened quite some times for me and has put me into a very bad shape.
<br />
<br />This time though, I thought about a mechanism to satisfy myself and others.
<br />
<br />I normally keep some work for the next day morning. I found out that this was the culprit. So, decided not to plan for tomorrow. Everyday morning I shall get up without any pressure to reach office in time and start as planned yesterday. Instead, reach office and then spend a cool 30 minutes looking into the “This Week” notes and preparing “This Day” notes.
<br />
<br />Now comes the interesting part. Do not start off with the first task at hand. Instead, read a technical book (thats what interests me in morning. Novel's are for evening) for 30 minutes - 45 minutes.
<br />
<br />Check official mails and get on to the first task at hand. Normally, I keep one task for rest of the time till lunch hour.
<br />
<br />After lunch, play a game of carrom till end of lunch break and get on to read blogs. Start the next task or continue the pending task from then on.
<br />
<br />This pattern has really worked out very well for me and my company supports such a people-driven environment.
<br />
<br />Things are getting to feel great and the problems also get solved in much more efficient way.
<br />
<br />Currently reading “applying UML and Patterns”,Craig larman.
<br />
<br />Although, have read the beginning chapters earlier, upon reading the chapter 2 (UP) I am feeling as though our team has naturally fallen into such a precise process. The description of the process correctly fits into the daily work what happens in our team. Some of the +'s being, “ye-but”, weekly iteration, iterations not producing prototypes instead working system, rapid feedback from client, constant refactoring etc...
<br />
<br />Feels great that any process that keeps people in front does survive without regard to what that process is called. Good that our team has not fallen pray to the “people for process” scenario.
<br />
<br />Book reading
<br />Blogging
<br />Brooding over .NET
