Yesterday, I was successful in hosting my sample ASP.NET web application over the free ASP.NET web hosting facility available at <a href="http://europe.webmatrixhosting.net/">http://europe.webmatrixhosting.net/</a>
<br />
<br />The best part was the usage of the System.Web.Mail namespace's MailMessage Type.
<br />
<br />Pretty cool stuff I thought.
<br />
<br />Just set the properties of the email message to be sent; choose the smtp server and lo, message is sent.
<br />
<br />since my company's smtp server was temporarily not receiving mails, learnt about Relay server and other SMTP related stuff. (Thanks to my SysAdmin, Mr. Sudeesh)
<br />
<br />Currently using hotmail's smtp server.
<br />
<br />The smtp server was OK today and hence i can now use the Web.config to store the smtp server address.
<br />
<br />All it took to put up two pages of functional ASP.NET site was 2 hours.
<br />
<br />My sample application stands at <a href="http://ideamani.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/">http://ideamani.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/</a>
<br />
<br />GTG Treking....
