While having discussion with my friend yesterday, I realized that “There's plenty of room in C# Types”.
<br />
<br />Some of the questions i faced were:
<br />
<br />Why did they go for Value Types?
<br />
<br />What is actually a Stack and Heap?
<br />
<br />Many more fundamental doubts arised. I am now in quest for answering those fundamental questions.
<br />
<br />The First, among the plethora of doubts would be to clear “How much memory is allocated in Stack and in Heap for a simple program like the one below?”
<br />
<br />//simple.cs
<br />namespace ManiSoft.Practice
<br />{
<br />   internal class Simple
<br />   {
<br />       public static void Main()
<br />      {
<br />           int x;
<br />           x = 7;
<br />      }
<br />   }
<br />}
<br />
<br />Also wondering at
<br />
<br />Is x a Value Type? (B'cause it is within a Reference Type)
<br />
<br />Ok. Out to read some basic stuff from Jeff Richter.
