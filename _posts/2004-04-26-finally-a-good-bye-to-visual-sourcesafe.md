In my previous <a href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mani.net/archive/2003/12/23/4854.aspx">post</a> on “Using CVS with VS.NET”, I've discussed the need to switch to CVS and also the problems faced in doing so.
<br />
<br />After long time (nearly 2 months) my team has finally become very comfortable with using CVS and VS.NET. Looking back 2 months from today, I get reminded of those days when a whole day would be spent by me wondering who did what and what went wrong. With good push from my team-mate, Jimson, CVS was finally chosen as our Source Control. We did find a good plug-in called “<a href="http://www.pushok.com/">Push-Ok</a>” for VS.NET 2003. An excellent plug-in I should say. But, it came for a price.
<br />We chose to stick on to <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">Tortoise CVS </a>and take the hard way around. We found that apart from files being edited by us, the VS.NET IDE also changed some files (like .csproj). Then with the help of Jimson, found out the right files to got into the CVS repository. Thus, after a half day session for the team on how to use “CVS with VS.NET” things got settled and now everyone seems to be comfortable with the “Copy-Modify-Merge” way of doing things.
<br />
<br />A great feeling and a great relief....
<br />
<br />Good going team.....
