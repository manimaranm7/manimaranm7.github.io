It makes me awe at the pace with which Microsoft is introducing new products. Added to that list is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vsts-over.asp">Microsoft VS Team System</a>. Just the kind of product we wanted.
<br />
<br />Got to appreciate the way this product was released. No clue about it till the last minute of announcement. Being a avid reader of the blogs, not many gave any clue about such a product. (or, have there been news about it? Not to my knowledge!)
<br />
<br />While the attention was diverted in the blogs about new features in existing products (Office and Whidbey) or about features in some distant product (Longhorn), a silent product was under development with tight lips.
<br />
<br />Now, is Microsoft creating a pattern for the usage of blogs. “Use blogs mostly for gaining/providing insights into distant/existing products”
<br />
<br />This becomes evident as a blog being created immediately for VS Team System!
<br />Any case, good going!
<br />
<br />Lots of stuff ahead in 2005.
