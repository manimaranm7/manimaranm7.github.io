<span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;">Yesterday, attended the MSDN Yatra's 'ASP.NET Application Security' session by MVP Srinivas Sampath.</span>
<br /><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">
<br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Was a very well balanced session.
<br /></span>
<br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Started with the Theory of Planning an ASP.NET application for good security.
<br /></span>
<br /><span style="font-size:85%;">The different stages at which the security can be provided was explained with a neat diagram.</span></span>
<br /></span><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">
<br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Usage of SSL was the highlight of the presentation.
<br /></span>
<br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Also usage of Stored Procedures instead of writing SQL in code was emphasized upon.
<br /></span>
<br /><span style="font-size:85%;">There were around 4 good demos.
<br /></span>
<br /><span style="font-size:85%;">One was how to configure IIS to enable SSL security.
<br /></span>
<br /><span style="font-size:85%;">The best was the Login Demo. It demonstrated a good template for authentication. Usage of Salt(Random Number), FormsAuthentication methods to store passwords safely in database.
<br /></span>
<br /><span style="font-size:85%;">It was followed by Authorization demo; identifying of User Roles etc.
<br /></span>
<br /><span style="font-size:85%;">I am going to implement these in my Application.
<br /></span>
<br /><span style="font-size:85%;">That's it for now.</span></span>
<br /></span>
