Today's task of the day was to enjoy. So, the <a href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata">Kata </a>was to experiment with Forms Authentication.
<br />
<br />It has taken nearly a week to understand the Security Issues related with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net">ASP.NET </a>application. Finally got a hang on Roles, Users,IPrinciple,Encryption and all other simple matters related to security.
<br />
<br />The best part of today's Kata was that it got over is just 60 minutes (The last 60 minutes of the day).
<br />
<br />Two more kata's are pending. One is to integrate the previous kata on Storing Encrypted passwords in Database with today's kata. The second is to integrate the resulting kata with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/patterns">User Interface Process Application Block</a>.
<br />
<br />Off to meet a friend and discuss C# Types.
