<p>I run a Virtual PC with Vista 32-bit as Guest operating system for my software development purposes. This VPC is quite slow despite taking measures to shut down various background services.</p> <p>For reasons beyond my understanding (and me not willing to investigate on it), whenever a MMC console window is opened, CPU usage spikes to 100%. It was frustrating to to start SQL Server Engine by going to the services.msc console. So, I found a way to start SQL Server service from command line.</p> <p>&nbsp;<a href="http://peakbyte.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/tmpe0b41.png" target="_blank"><img style="border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="44" alt="tmpE0B4" src="http://peakbyte.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/tmpe0b4-thumb1.png" width="244" border="0"></a></p> <p>Please click on above image to see the command in clarity.</p>
