“How to train the non-techies on .NET?“
<br />
<br />“What should you start with and where to stop?”
<br />
<br />These were just a couple of challenges I had to face this week at the training program organized at my workplace for the freshmen who joined our team a couple of weeks back.
<br />
<br />The challenge becomes more interesting when the group consists of few computer science graduates and few non-computer science graduates.
<br />
<br />There needs to be a balance in the amount of information departed. More technical terms, and the ideas will bounce off the non-techie group. Using more general terms to explain any stuff becomes more trivial for techies.
<br />
<br />We'll the agenda was to instill the basics of .NET and a proper foundation so that the later sessions (C#, ASP.NET, ADO.NET) have no difficulty.
<br />
<br />Keeping that in mind, I decided to use the same presentation I had used at the
<br />CorporateConnexion @ Christ College. On review, found that it was loaded with technical stuff and may bounce off even the techie freshmen.
<br />
<br />So, that presentation now had to be trimmed.
<br />
<br />First, I decided to instill the idea that:
<br />
<br />     .NET was not any single software 
<br />     .NET has been mainly been developed to create Enterprise Applications
<br />
<br />To get this idea instilled, used an anology of a House Construction and Enterprise Application Construction.
<br />
<br />This made it possible to understand “Where exactly .NET fits into the Software Industry?”
<br />
<br />The second half was to just clear the jargons surrounding .NET
<br />
<br />Just displayed the various components of .NET that will be used to create an enterprise application.
<br />
<br />The various types of applications that can be created (Web Application, Desktop Application)
<br />
<br />The various role played by Asp.NET, Ado.NET, Web Forms, WinForms
<br />
<br />The presentation can be found <a href="http://geocities.com/manimaranm7/Presentation/basic.net.zip">here</a>
